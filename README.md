# Obstacle-avoider-Robot 
This is a code that helps a robot to sense the obstacle on its course and to take turns to surpass the obstacles.
Obstacles are sensed with the help of IR sensors and this code helps the microcontroller to understand the values of the sensors to direct the robot to move on its course.
